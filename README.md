## Basic Phone Functions - Contact List/Messages

This exercise works with a contact class and a message class to replicate the functionality of a phone. The user can go through a menu option branch in order to accomplish specific tasks with it always defaulting back to the initial options after one is completed or if they wish to go back from a point farther down in the branch.

The menu tree looks is as follows:

1. Manage Contacts
    - Show all contacts 
    - Add new contact
    - Search for a contact
    - Delete a contact
    - Go back (to main 3)
2. Messages
    - Show all messages
    - Send a new message
    - Go back (to main 3)
3. Quit

## Limitations
When creating contacts, a name and number are required, but the email is optional.

Searching for a contact requires the full name to be entered.
